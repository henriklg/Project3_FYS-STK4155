# Project 3 - Our first venture into Convolutional Neural Networks
This is the code written for the final project (#3) for the course FYS-STK4155, code by Betina, Ingrid, Polina, Mona and Henrik

### Abstract:
In this project we study and attempt to make an comparison between our ownNumPy-based CNN, Keras CNN, TensorFlow CNN and support vector machinemodel of MNIST database. We find that to make a computationally fast CNN isquite hard. However, prediction accuracy for NumPy-based CNN, Keras CNN,TensorFlow CNN and support vector machine models are 95.3%, 98.9%, 99.0%and 96.9%, respectively.  Due to computational difficulties of NumPy-basedCNN we had to resort to a smaller database of digits, 8 x 8 database, to obtainsuch a good accuracy.Another aspects that we could emphasize in case of NumPy-based, Ten-sorFlow and Keras CNNs is that employed structure of CNN model and thetraining has an immense impact on the final prediction accuracy.
